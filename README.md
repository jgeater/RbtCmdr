initial commit


This utility make it a little easier to control various reboot and workstation Powermanagment options in one applet.

With this you can Sleep, hibernate, logoff, shutdown, restart, Restart to the firmware, and restart to the advanced windows options.

Currently because iof the last two items in the list this will prompt admin rights on launch via UAC. I plan to update it soon so that
it will prompt for elevation only when one of the last two are selected.
